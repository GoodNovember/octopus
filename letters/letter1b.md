# Letter 1b

Dear Persephonie, I hear the music is coming along nicely. I would like to get in touch in the next few days to see about starting our other project. I have some sketches and prototypes that I am eager to share. Let me know when would be a good time for you. My shcedule is open anytime from Friday till Tuesday from 9pm till 3am. I trust you still have the password.

See you soon.

~ Dirk.
